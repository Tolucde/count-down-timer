# Frontend Mentor Challenge- Room homepage



## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge. I attempted this front end mentor challenge  to improve my skills in a real-life workflow, it tested my knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript

###The challenge was to build out this countdown timer and get it looking as close to the design as possible
